# Health Report Summarizer - Extract Key Information

This project aims to **summarize patient medical reports** by extracting key information from PDF documents using **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** and text processing techniques.  
The system enhances extracted data through **custom preprocessing pipelines**, generating a structured and readable summary for better healthcare insights.



## Features
- **OCR-based Text Extraction**: Extracts text from scanned PDF documents using Pytesseract.  
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Cleans and structures extracted text using custom preprocessing steps.  
- **Structured Summary Generation**: Converts processed data into a concise and readable summary.  
- **Interactive User Interface**: Streamlit-based interface for uploading PDFs and viewing summarized results.  


##  Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **OCR Engine**: Pytesseract (Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR)  
- **PDF Processing**: PDF2Image (convert PDF pages into images for OCR)  
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV (improve OCR accuracy)  
- **Data Handling**: Pandas (manipulation and structuring of extracted text)  
- **Deployment & UI**: Streamlit (web-based user interface)
